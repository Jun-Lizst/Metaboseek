abstract = {Metabolite profiling in biomarker discovery, enzyme substrate assignment, drug activity/specificity determination, and basic metabolic research requires new data preprocessing approaches to correlate specific metabolites to their biological origin. Here we introduce an LC/MS-based data analysis approach, XCMS, which incorporates novel nonlinear retention time alignment, matched filtration, peak detection, and peak matching. Without using internal standards, the method dynamically identifies hundreds of endogenous metabolites for use as standards, calculating a nonlinear retention time correction profile for each sample. Following retention time correction, the relative metabolite ion intensities are directly compared to identify changes in specific endogenous metabolites, such as potential biomarkers. The software is demonstrated using data sets from a previously reported enzyme knockout study and a large-scale study of plasma samples.

@article{Kind2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Structure elucidation of unknown small molecules by mass spectrometry is a challenge despite advances in instrumentation. The first crucial step is to obtain correct elemental compositions. In order to automatically constrain the thousands of possible candidate structures, rules need to be developed to select the most likely and chemically correct molecular formulas. RESULTS An algorithm for filtering molecular formulas is derived from seven heuristic rules: (1) restrictions for the number of elements, (2) LEWIS and SENIOR chemical rules, (3) isotopic patterns, (4) hydrogen/carbon ratios, (5) element ratio of nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor, and sulphur versus carbon, (6) element ratio probabilities and (7) presence of trimethylsilylated compounds. Formulas are ranked according to their isotopic patterns and subsequently constrained by presence in public chemical databases. The seven rules were developed on 68,237 existing molecular formulas and were validated in four experiments. First, 432,968 formulas covering five million PubChem database entries were checked for consistency. Only 0.6{\%} of these compounds did not pass all rules. Next, the rules were shown to effectively reducing the complement all eight billion theoretically possible C, H, N, S, O, P-formulas up to 2000 Da to only 623 million most probable elemental compositions. Thirdly 6,000 pharmaceutical, toxic and natural compounds were selected from DrugBank, TSCA and DNP databases. The correct formulas were retrieved as top hit at 80-99{\%} probability when assuming data acquisition with complete resolution of unique compounds and 5{\%} absolute isotope ratio deviation and 3 ppm mass accuracy. Last, some exemplary compounds were analyzed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and by gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry. In each case, the correct formula was ranked as top hit when combining the seven rules with database queries. CONCLUSION The seven rules enable an automatic exclusion of molecular formulas which are either wrong or which contain unlikely high or low number of elements. The correct molecular formula is assigned with a probability of 98{\%} if the formula exists in a compound database. For truly novel compounds that are not present in databases, the correct formula is found in the first three hits with a probability of 65-81{\%}.

@article{Morikawa2003,
abstract = {The present note compares some historical and analogous odd-even parities in mathematics and chemistry. The mathematical starting point was thefamous problem of the Koenigsberg Bridges in olden East Prussia, which was firstsolved by Euler in 1736. The first statement of an even number rule in chemistry wasmade by Laurent in 1843{\~{n}}1846. Laurent{\'{i}}s parity, known as the principle of valencebalance in modern chemistry, differs from Euler{\'{i}}s rule; thus, the two are not consid-ered to be equivalent. Another analogy in odd-even parity is strongly related to thenumber of cycles in networks such as graphs in mathematics and electrical circuits inphysics. The correspondence to such a number in chemical compounds is known asthe degree of unsaturation. Describing the analogy of this number in mathematicsand chemistry is another purpose of this review. A history of the odd/even numberrules can help to clarify the role of mathematics in chemistry. The two aspects, va-lence balance and unsaturation, have been unified into graph-theoretical criteria bythe mathematician Senior in a key chemistry paper, but not well-known to chemists,published in 1951. The present contribution describes some pathways leading fromEuler{\'{i}}s work to that of Senior.},
