# METABOseek

The Metabolite Online Sprectrum Analysis Center is here to help you analyze your mass spectrometry data!

Visit our website at http://Mseek.bti.cornell.edu to test METABOseek online and to sign up for our Newsletter!

<a href = "http://Mseek.bti.cornell.edu/doc/METABOseek_documentation.html">Installation and data analysis documentation</a>

METABOseek is an interactive tool to analyze and browse your mass spectrometry data.
It is built on functions from the <a href = "https://github.com/sneumann/xcms">xcms</a> package, and provides a web-based graphical user interface built with <a href = "http://shiny.rstudio.com/">shiny</a>.

METABOseek is currently under development, and new features are constantly added.

Currently available online:
- Find metabolites of interest in an MS feature table (generated  with XCMS and other tools)
- Browse and plot extracted ion chromatograms of many samples and LC/MS features in parallel
- Find LC/MS features that are different between your samples, perform statistical analyses and / or create high-quality graphics for publication!
- View  mass spectra, predict molecular formulas


Coming soon:
- Search MSn databases
- Annotate Peaks
