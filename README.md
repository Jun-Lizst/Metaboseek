# METABOseek

METABOseek is here to help you analyze your mass spectrometry data!

Visit our website at https://metaboseek.com to test METABOseek online

<a href = "https://metaboseek.com/doc.html">Installation and data analysis documentation</a>

METABOseek is an interactive tool to analyze and browse your mass spectrometry data.
It is built on functions from the <a href = "https://github.com/sneumann/xcms">xcms</a> package, and provides a web-based graphical user interface built with <a href = "http://shiny.rstudio.com/">shiny</a>.

METABOseek is currently under development, and new features are constantly added.

- Find metabolites of interest in an MS feature table (generated  with XCMS and other tools)
- Browse and plot extracted ion chromatograms of many samples and LC/MS features in parallel
- Find LC/MS features that are different between your samples, perform statistical analyses and / or create high-quality graphics for publication!
- View  mass spectra, predict molecular formulas and structures
- Integrated molecular networking functionality
